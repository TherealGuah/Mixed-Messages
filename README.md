## About

    This project was developed solo, as part of my ongoing **Pro Career Path** as _**Full-Stack Engineer**_.

    The objective is to create a programme that will forecast weather randomly and output into the console with some ASCII art.

    Future integration into HTML/CSS will be done to integrate it into my Portfolio. (check Updates)

## Technologies

 +  Git / Github
 +  Bash
 +  JavaScript

 
## How to Run

    You will need to install [NODE.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be able to run the programme for now.
    

## Updates

### 1.0 (29/12/2020)

    ASCII art integrated into JS and programme is generating correctly.
